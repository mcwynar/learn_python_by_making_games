# Pass + input

# Pass tells Python to not do anything
# You can add this to a function if you don't have code yet

# Input is one way to get user input
# Although it is very rarely used


def really_important_function_name():
    # without it we will get error (Python expected an indented block after function)
    pass


user_input = input('Press a button ')
print(user_input)
